# Week 12

In this lesson, we will explore the future of big data and deep learning. 

## Objectives

After completing this week, you should be able to:

* Describe upcoming advances in big data and deep learning and their potential use cases
* Experiment with advanced deep learning use cases including text and image generation

## Readings

* Chapter 12 in *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*
* Read chapters 8 and 9 in *Deep Learning with Python*

## Weekly Resources

## Assignment 12

Using section 8.4 in *Deep Learning with Python* as a guide, implement a variational autoencoder using the MNIST data set and save a grid of 15 x 15 digits to the `results/vae` directory. If you would rather work on a more interesting dataset, you can use the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/celeb_a) instead. 

## Submission Instructions

For this assignment, you will submit a zip archive containing the contents of the `dsc650/assignments/assignment12/` directory. Use the naming convention of `assignment12_LastnameFirstname.zip` for the zip archive. You can create this archive in Bash (or a similar Unix shell) using the following commands. 

```shell
cd dsc650/assignments
zip -r assignment12_DoeJane.zip assignment10
```

Likewise, you can create a zip archive using Windows PowerShell with the following command. 

```shell
Compress-Archive -Path assignment10 -DestinationPath 'assignment12_DoeJane.zip
```

## Discussion Board

For this discussion, pick an area of big data or deep learning that we did discuss in-depth and explain why you find it exciting. Topics include, but are not limited to Kubernetes, deep learning hardware, and cloud computing. Write a 250 to 750-word discussion board post to describe this topic. Use the DSC 650 Slack channel for discussion and replies.
