# Latency

*Latency Numbers Every Data Scientist Should Know*

In the 2000s, Jeff Dean, a Google Senior Fellow in their Research Group, [presented a list of latency numbers that every programmer should know](http://highscalability.com/numbers-everyone-should-know). These numbers describe how long it takes to perform certain actions within distributed programs. Since then, it has been [updated](http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/1/15/more-numbers-every-awesome-programmer-must-know.html) and [expanded upon](https://medium.com/@hondanhon/more-latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know-3142f0cf614d).

Below is yet another update on these numbers with data taken from [Colin Scott](https://github.com/colin-scott/interactive_latencies), a Berkeley researcher. An interactive version of this repository can be found [here](https://colin-scott.github.io/personal_website/research/interactive_latency.html).

| Main memory reference              |          100 ns |                   |                 |
| Compress 1KB with Zippy            |        2,000 ns |         2 &mu;s   |                 |
| Send 1KB over 1 Gbps network       |       10,000 ns |        10 &mu;s   |                 |
| SSD random read                    |       16,000 ns |        16 &mu;s   |                 |

*Notes*

[^1]: 1 ns = 10<sup>-9</sup> seconds
[^2]: 1 &mu;s = 10<sup>-6</sup> seconds = 1,000 ns
[^3]: 1 ms = 10<sup>-3</sup> seconds = 1,000 &mu;s = 1,000,000 ns
